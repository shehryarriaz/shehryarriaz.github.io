<p>Hi, I'm Shehryar. Nice to meet you.</p>

<p>I believe in creating products and experiences that are both functional and beautiful. After studying interactive media and game design for my undergraduate degree I spent two years in finance. I joined General Assembly to return to my love of designing digital products, and to learn how to build them from the ground up myself. I feel empowered to take on new challenges, continue learning, and am keen to put my skills to use. I am looking for a full-time role within a driven team who focus on design and usability as much as engineering.</p>
