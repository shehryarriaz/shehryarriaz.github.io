<p>Hi, I'm Shehryar. Nice to meet you.</p>

<p>I’m a web developer and game designer. I believe in creating products and experiences that are both functional and beautiful. At the moment, I’m looking for a full-time role with a driven team who focus on design and usability as much as engineering.</p>

<p>For my undergraudate degree I studied Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University with a focus on game design at the <a href="http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/">NYU Game Center</a>. I started my career as an assistant project manager in finance, predominantly working on large-scale service implemenations. Recently however, I joined <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly’s</a> Web Development Immersive as a student to return to my love of designing and building digital products.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding I can be found hiking, sketching, painting, or immersed in the latest indie game.</p>

<p> Please take a look at <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/ShehryarRiaz_CV.pdf"><strong>my CV</strong></a> if you're interested in working together.</p>
